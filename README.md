Calhter is a easy to use CLI that generates a clean and customizable static web site for viewing your markdown files.
It's ideal to documentations, tutorials etc.

There are many existing tools ([docsfy](https://docsify.js.org/#/), [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)) that
aim to do the same thing, so why should one use Calhter? Well, maybe you shouldn't.
